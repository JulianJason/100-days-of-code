**Today's Progress**: Accepted Challenged, added Indonesian translation to 100 days of code

**Thoughts:** Most of the time was spent on renumerating on what I want to achieve on the next 100 days. Well, I was notorious in being bad in estimations (Still is, but not by a ballpark anymore!). I realized that while I am comfortable with React, I am nowhere comfortable with plain old html js css. So I spent the rest of the day going through resources I should have read ages ago. (FreeCodeCamp + javascript.info)

**Today's Progress**: Today I forced myself to go back to step one and be framework free. I created a basic website to describe who I am using plain HTML CSS JS and


**Thoughts:** So my front end journey began with React. That means I do not really have a good foundation of framework-less HTML + CSS + JS development. I think I might have underestimated plain old HTML CSS JS. In particular, I have always used npm and some bundler like webpack so it was quite an ephiphany that you dont have to use NPM and simply fetch js libs from CDN via <script> tags.

##### Day 2: 11th August 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to learn SVG. I began by reading on MDN on what's SVG, then I looked around for SVG animating libraries. Found two, anime.js and GSAP. Also I drafted a hero video background and used anime.js to animate the title. Pretty nifty


**Thoughts:** Well color me impressed. SVG animation is actually not that resource consuming. On first glance, It seems that GSAP is more robust but it is locking its nifty feature behind a paid license. Decided to go with anime.js because I really want to play around with the MorphSVG function.

##### Day 3: 12th August 2020

**Today's Progress**: Well something different today, I decided to create a codepen account and play with GSAP. I was inspired by a coin that fell from my table and briefly spun around, so I created a flip-a-coin codepen and tried to animate it with GSAP.


**Thoughts:** I had some trouble layering the html + css and also wasted some time looking at forums only to realize that they are using GSAP 2 and I am using the new GSAP 3. For those who are reading - TweenMax, timelineMax are GSAP 2 features. GSAP 3 combines them all under 1 GSAP object.
Aside from that, it has been pretty nifty. 3-dimensional rotation still requires trial and error for me but I'm slowly getting a hang of it.
